# Continous Control Project

## The Environment
Follow the instructions below to explore the environment on your own machine! You will also learn how to use the Python API to control your agent.

### Step 1: Activate the Environment
If you haven't already, please follow the <a href="https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies">instructions in the DRLND GitHub repository</a> to set up your Python environment. These instructions can be found in README.md at the root of the repository. By following these instructions, you will install PyTorch, the ML-Agents toolkit, and a few more Python packages required to complete the project.

(For Windows users) The ML-Agents toolkit supports Windows 10. While it might be possible to run the ML-Agents toolkit using other versions of Windows, it has not been tested on other versions. Furthermore, the ML-Agents toolkit has not been tested on a Windows VM such as Bootcamp or Parallels.

### Step 2: Download the Unity Environment
For this project, you will not need to install Unity - this is because we have already built the environment for you, and you can download it from one of the links below. You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

Version 1: One (1) Agent
<br/>
Linux: <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux.zip">click here</a>
<br/>
Mac OSX: <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher.app.zip">click here</a>
<br/>
Windows (32-bit): <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip">click here</a>
<br/>
Windows (64-bit): <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip">click here</a>
<br/>
Version 2: Twenty (20) Agents
<br/>
Linux: <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Linux.zip">click here</a>
<br/>
Mac OSX: <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher.app.zip">click here</a>
<br/>
Windows (32-bit): <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip">click here</a> 
<br/>
Windows (64-bit): <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip">click here</a> 
<br/>
Then, place the file in the p2_continuous-control/ folder in the DRLND GitHub repository, and unzip (or decompress) the file.

### Step 3: Explore the Environment
After you have followed the instructions above, open Continuous_Control.ipynb (located in the p2_continuous-control/ folder in the DRLND GitHub repository) and follow the instructions to learn how to use the Python API to control the agent.

Watch the (silent) video below to see what kind of output to expect from the notebook (for version 2 of the environment), if everything is working properly! Version 1 will look very similar (where you'll see a single agent, instead of 20!).
